	abstract = {Off-task and disruptive classroom behavior impedes the learning of the children emitting these behaviors as well as the delivery of instruction to the entire class, which may lead to decreased academic achievement and more severe behavior problems. A meta-analysis of the single-case literature was conducted to understand the effectiveness of class-wide interventions in supporting student behavior in general education settings. Twenty-nine studies of K--12 classrooms, published between January 1969 and September 2015, were included for analysis. Two effect sizes, the Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2012, 2013) d-statistic and Tau-U (Parker, Vannest, Davis, & Sauber, 2011), were calculated for relevant studies and designs. The results of a random-effects meta-analysis using the d-statistic resulted in an estimated overall effect of 2.04 (95% CI [1.67, 2.41]) and an overall effect of 0.93 (95% CI [0.87, 0.99]) using Tau-U. The implications of these findings for interventions implemented in the general education classroom are discussed.},

	abstract = {Group contingencies are recognized as a potent intervention for addressing challenging student behavior in the classroom, with research reviews supporting the use of this intervention platform going back more than four decades. Over this time period, the field of education has increasingly emphasized the role of research evidence for informing practice, as reflected in the increased use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In the current article, we continue this trend by applying recently developed between-case effect size measures and transparent visual analysis procedures to synthesize an up-to-date set of group contingency studies that used single-case designs. Results corroborated recent systematic reviews by indicating that group contingencies are generally effective---particularly for addressing challenging behavior in general education classrooms. However, our review highlights the need for more research on students with disabilities and the need to collect and report information about participants' functional level.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review was to evaluate the methodological strength and overall effectiveness of the research underlying the FRIENDS program for preventing anxiety in students at low and elevated risk for developing anxiety disorders. Meta-analytic findings provided mixed results, with low-risk students exposed to the program having demonstrated small improvements over comparisons for immediate posttest measures of anxiety. Findings drawn from follow-up data collection periods indicated that low-risk students sustained initial gains on anxiety over 12 months but not beyond. In addition, no immediate posttest difference was found between students at elevated risk on measures of anxiety. These findings are discussed in terms of practical and methodological limitations of the body of research.},

Specifically, the procedures used for preparing, aggregating, analyzing, and evaluating single-subject data across 68 primary syntheses were examined. In addition to these methodological and reporting issues, the present review also considered various characteristics of syntheses to determine their overall prevalence and focus. Results of the review indicated that the publication rate of single-subject meta-analyses has increased considerably in recent years, focusing equally on students with high- and low-incidence disabilities. This review revealed considerable variability in the methods and procedures used to synthesize single-subject research. Based on these findings, suggestions for future single-subject meta-analyses were made.},

To date, there is no standardized method for RJ implementation. Therefore, this systematic literature review investigates peer-reviewed studies on the application of RJ practices in K-12 school settings. Ten articles were included in the review. Results of the review indicate a high degree of variability regarding the implementation and evaluation of RJ practices in schools. However, the majority of studies reported positive outcomes, including improved social relationships and reductions in office discipline referrals. The utility of RJ as a school violence prevention and intervention approach are discussed, along with future research directions.},

The first part of the review utilized the recently published What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards for evaluating single-subject research to determine the extent to which eligible studies demonstrated sufficient evidence to classify the token economy as an evidence-based practice. The second part of the review employed meta-analytic techniques across four different types of effect sizes to evaluate the quantitative strength of the findings. Methodological strengths and weaknesses across the studies were systematically investigated. Results indicated that the extant research on token economies does not provide sufficient evidence to be deemed best-practice based on the WWC criteria.},

An application of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) procedures for evaluating single-subject research revealed that the research investigating group contingencies demonstrated sufficient rigor, evidence, and replication to label the intervention as evidence-based. These findings were further supported across five quantitative indices of treatment effect. The results associated with the application of the WWC procedures and quantitative evaluations were supplemented with additional systematic coding of methodological features and study characteristics to evaluate the populations and conditions under which the effects of the group contingency best generalize. Findings associated with this coding revealed that the lack of detailed reporting across studies limited our ability to determine for whom and under what conditions group contingencies are best suited.},

@article{Kilgus2014-db,
	abstract = {School personnel make a variety of decisions within multitiered problem-solving frameworks, including the decision to assign a student to group-based support, to design an individualized support plan, or classify a student as eligible for special education. Each decision is founded upon a judgment regarding whether the student has responded to intervention. These and other conclusions are inherently causal, thus requiring that educators carefully consider the internal, construct, and conclusion validity of each decision to ensure its defensibility. Researchers have identified multiple variables that are likely to moderate these validities, including the integrity with which interventions are implemented, the psychometric adequacy of progress-monitoring tools, the extent to which interventions and supports are matched to a student's needs, and the approach to single-case research design. We therefore review each of these variables in the interest of assisting practitioners to design acceptable and valid multi-tiered frameworks of prevention and service delivery.},

Video self‐modeling is an effective and efficient evidence‐based intervention for a variety of student problem behaviors. However, like many other evidence‐based interventions, it is not frequently used in schools. As video creation technology becomes increasingly accessible, school psychologists are better able to incorporate video self‐modeling into their practice. Built on a comprehensive review, this article describes the procedures for implementing a video self‐modeling intervention in educational settings. Video self‐modeling procedures described herein include (a) deciding whether video self‐modeling is an appropriate intervention for a situation, (b) planning for and preparing video self‐modeling procedures, (c) videotaping, (d) editing the video, (e) presenting the video, and (f) using video self‐modeling with other behavioral techniques.

Although substantial work has been conducted to support systems-level implementation and intervention for behavior, concomitant advances in behavior assessment have been limited. This is despite the central role that data derived from behavior assessment methods must play in making defensible multi-tiered decisions such as those for screening and progress monitoring. In this commentary, the role of assessment in the evidence-based practice movement is described, alongside necessary features of behavior assessment methods utilized in multi-tiered systems. The relevance of these features to articles in this special issue is described.

Ten graduate-student raters, with an average of 7.20 hr of previous training in systematic direct observation and 58.20 hr of previous direct observation experience, scored 6 videos of student behavior using 12 different time-sampling protocols. Five videos were submitted for analysis, and results for observations using momentary time-sampling and whole-interval recording suggested that the majority of variance was attributable to the rating occasion, although results for partial-interval recording generally demonstrated large residual components comparable with those seen in prior research. Dependability coefficients were above .80 when averaging across 1 to 2 raters using momentary time-sampling, and 2 to 3 raters using whole-interval recording. Ratings derived from partial-interval recording needed to be averaged over 3 to 7 raters to demonstrate dependability coefficients above .80.},

	abstract = {Class-wide behavioral interventions are a feasible and effective method to support the behavior of all students. In six peer-reviewed studies, Tootling, a class-wide intervention that combines positive peer reporting with an interdependent group contingency, has increased positive peer reports and academically engaged behavior (AEB), and decreased disruptive behavior (DB). However, no prior studies have been conducted with middle school students, and none have employed strategies to promote enduring behavior change. A withdrawal design with maintenance phase, implemented across two middle school classrooms, found moderate effects (nonoverlap of all pairs [NAP] = 0.74, Tau-U = −0.48) of Tootling on decreasing DB and moderate to large effects (NAP = 0.76, Tau-U = 0.68) on increasing AEB, although internal threats to validity prevented the demonstration of a clear functional relationship across both classrooms. Results from the maintenance phase, in which the group contingency reward was removed, suggest promising strategies to support durable behavioral change. Limitations of the present study, directions for future research, social validity, and implications for practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {Many teachers struggle to deliver interventions with sufficient treatment integrity, perhaps due to implementation variables that mediate or moderate treatment integrity. Potential implementation variables have frequently been conceptualized in ecological frameworks, including the intervention, implementer, organization, and external environmental levels. Although the ecological framework is a useful organizational tool, a measure aligned with this model of implementation variables has not yet been developed. This article describes the development of the Assessment of Ecological Implementation Influences (AEII), a measure to evaluate implementation variables across ecological levels. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to evaluate to what extent responses on the AEII reflect the hypothesized ecological factor structure. The model of variables from the intervention to external environment level was not reflected within the factor structure here. Rather, factors emerged that were not previously accounted for in the implementation variables literature. Implications for future research on the measurement of treatment integrity and implementation variables are described.},

Data derived from these screening assessments may be evaluated according to their classification accuracy, or the degree to which cut scores correctly identify individuals as ``at-risk'' or ``not-at-risk.'' The current study examined the performance of mean scores derived from over 1700 students in Grades 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 using Direct Behavior Rating---Single Item Scales. Students were rated across three time points (Fall, Winter, Spring) by their teachers in three areas: (a) academically engaged behavior, (b) disruptive behavior, and (c) respectful behavior. Classification accuracy indices and comparisons among behaviors were derived using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, partial area under the curve (pAUC) tests, and bootstrapping methods to evaluate the degree to which mean behavior ratings accurately identified students who demonstrated elevated behavioral symptomology on the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System. Results indicated that optimal cut-scores for mean behavior ratings and a composite rating demonstrated high levels of specificity, sensitivity, and negative predictive value, with sensitivity point estimates for optimal cut-scores exceeding .70 for individual behaviors and .75 for composite scores across grade groups and time points.},

We field tested several recently developed methods for single-case design syntheses. First, we appraised the quality of individual studies and the overall body of work using Council for Exceptional Children's standards. Next, we calculated and meta-analyzed within-case and between-case effect sizes. Results indicated that studies were of high methodological quality, with nine studies identified as being methodologically sound and demonstrating positive outcomes across 14 participants. However, insufficient evidence was available to classify the evidence base for FABIs due to small number of participants within (fewer than recommended three) and across (fewer than recommended 20) studies. Nonetheless, average within-case effect sizes were equivalent to increases of 118% between baseline and intervention phases. Finally, potential moderating variables were examined.

	abstract = {Data derived from universal screening procedures are increasingly utilized by schools to identify and provide additional support to students at risk for behavioral and emotional concerns. As screening has the potential to be resource intensive, effort has been placed on the development of efficient screening procedures, including brief behavior rating scales (BBRS). This study utilized classical test theory and generalizability theory to examine the extent to which differences among students, raters, occasions, and screening measures affect the amount of variance in data derived from universal screening procedures. Teacher pairs from three middle school classrooms completed two BBRS during fall and spring for each student in their classrooms. Correlation coefficients examining interrater reliability, test--retest reliability, and convergent validity were generally strong. Generalizability analyses indicated that the majority of variance in teacher ratings was attributable to student differences across all score comparisons, but differences between teacher ratings for particular students accounted for relatively large percentages of error variance among student behavior ratings. Although decision studies suggested that increasing the number of screening occasions resulted in more generalizable data, they also demonstrated that increasing the number of raters not only resulted in more generalizable data but also procedures that are more efficient.},

However, teachers struggle to implement classroom management consistently and may need ongoing support. Identifying critical components of classroom management could help illuminate mechanisms of action and streamline teacher implementation while achieving the same positive student outcomes. This exploratory study evaluates the relative contributions of teachers' implementation of 14 best practice classroom management strategies on class-wide academic engagement. Findings suggest that frequent references to the schedule and routines, behavior-specific praise, and low rates of error correction are significantly related to high rates of class-wide academic engagement. We highlight implications for researchers interested in classroom management and its core components as well as school psychologists providing classroom management support to teachers.},

To this end, the current study examined the reliability and validity of data derived from three commonly utilized school-based behavioral assessment methods: Direct Behavior Rating -- Single Item Scales, systematic direct observations, and behavior rating scales on three common constructs of interest: academically engaged, disruptive, and respectful behavior. Further, this study included data from different sources including student self-report, teacher report, and external observers. A total of 831 students in grades 3--8 and 129 teachers served as participants. Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations of the MTMM, as well as single and multi-level structural equation modeling. Results suggested the presence of strong methods effects for all the assessment methods utilized, as well as significant relations between constructs of interest.

	abstract = {The successful implementation of school-based behavioral interventions requires school personnel to be competent with program content and procedures. An unfortunate trend within school-based behavioral intervention research is that the core intervention components and implementation features are often not fully described. Without clear descriptions of these critical elements, it is difficult for school personnel to successfully identify, adopt, and implement research-based programs. The practical implications that study reporting has on the integration of research into practice is illustrated in the present study through a systematic review of a widely researched anxiety prevention program. Results indicated that study authors often did not provide sufficient detail on the intervention components used and whether those components were implemented with sufficient levels of treatment fidelity. Moreover, the supports used to facilitate the implementation of the intervention varied widely across studies. These findings are discussed in relation to evidence suggesting that descriptions of the independent variable are important for identifying the mechanisms of adult and student behavior change while reports of implementation features are needed to ensure school personnel are able to consider the feasibility of implementing research-based programs within applied settings. The authors conclude by describing implications for both research and practice.},

In addition, there is a critical need to concurrently build a strong evidence base regarding trauma-informed service delivery in schools. In this paper, the literatures on trauma-informed approaches and multitiered frameworks for school-based service delivery are connected with the goal to provide suggestions toward building blueprints for trauma-informed service delivery in schools. Drawing from the literature on implementation blueprints for school-wide positive behavior supports, sections are organized around current knowledge about trauma-informed approaches with regard to blueprints for (a) implementation, (b) professional development, and (c) evaluation.
