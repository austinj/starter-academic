abstract: The purpose of this review was to synthesize the research underlying group
  contingency interventions to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support
  their use for managing the classroom behavior of students with behavioral difficulties.
  An application of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) procedures for evaluating single-subject
  research revealed that the research investigating group contingencies demonstrated
  sufficient rigor, evidence, and replication to label the intervention as evidence-based.
  These findings were further supported across five quantitative indices of treatment
  effect. The results associated with the application of the WWC procedures and quantitative
  evaluations were supplemented with additional systematic coding of methodological
  features and study characteristics to evaluate the populations and conditions under
  which the effects of the group contingency best generalize. Findings associated
  with this coding revealed that the lack of detailed reporting across studies limited
  our ability to determine for whom and under what conditions group contingencies
  are best suited.
