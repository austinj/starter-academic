abstract: To draw informed conclusions from research studies, research consumers need
  full and accurate descriptions of study methods and procedures. Preregistration
  has been proposed as a means to clarify reporting of research methods and procedures,
  with the goal of reducing bias in research. However, preregistration has been applied
  primarily to research studies utilizing group designs. In this article, we discuss
  general issues in preregistration and consider the use of preregistration in single-case
  design research, particularly as it relates to differing applications of this methodology.
  We then provide a rationale and make specific recommendations for preregistering
  single-case design research, including guidelines for preregistering basic descriptive
  information, research questions, participant characteristics, baseline conditions,
  independent and dependent variables, hypotheses, and phase-change decisions.
