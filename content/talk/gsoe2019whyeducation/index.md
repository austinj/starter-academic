# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "In his talk, Dr. Johnson will argue for reframing school discipline towards a focus on positive student behavior as one tool for enacting social justice in American schools. Dr. Johnson will describe the current state of school-based “discipline” strategies and their associated outcomes, contrast these with evidence-based practices focused on positive behavior, and suggest that what we need is not more research on what practices work, but more tools for making those practices happen in schools."
