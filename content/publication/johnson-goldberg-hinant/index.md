abstract: Functional Behavior Assessments (FBAs) utilize direct and indirect methods
  to collect data on student behavior to generate a functional hypothesis and drive
  intervention development. School psychologists are trained to conduct FBAs and use
  them regularly in schools. However, no evidence exists describing the specific practices
  used by school psychologists when they conduct FBAs. In this study, 199 respondents
  completed a web‐based survey developed using expert review and cognitive pretesting.
  Most respondents reported their gender as female (87%), were between 30 and 39 years
  old (50%), and practiced at the Specialist level (57%). Respondents reported receiving
  training in FBA across multiple sources and utilizing multi‐method data collection
  methods when conducting FBAs. A large amount of variability was observed in the
  specific instruments used by school psychologists, with a substantial proportion
  using forms that were not standardized or pre‐constructed. Implications for current
  practitioners, trainers, and researchers are described.
