abstract: The successful implementation of school-based behavioral interventions requires
  school personnel to be competent with program content and procedures. An unfortunate
  trend within school-based behavioral intervention research is that the core intervention
  components and implementation features are often not fully described. Without clear
  descriptions of these critical elements, it is difficult for school personnel to
  successfully identify, adopt, and implement research-based programs. The practical
  implications that study reporting has on the integration of research into practice
  is illustrated in the present study through a systematic review of a widely researched
  anxiety prevention program. Results indicated that study authors often did not provide
  sufficient detail on the intervention components used and whether those components
  were implemented with sufficient levels of treatment fidelity. Moreover, the supports
  used to facilitate the implementation of the intervention varied widely across studies.
  These findings are discussed in relation to evidence suggesting that descriptions
  of the independent variable are important for identifying the mechanisms of adult
  and student behavior change while reports of implementation features are needed
  to ensure school personnel are able to consider the feasibility of implementing
  research-based programs within applied settings. The authors conclude by describing
  implications for both research and practice.
