abstract: School-based teams are a core method for stakeholder collaboration and coordination.
  Although school teams are responsible for making numerous decisions, a limited number
  of measures exist to support the evaluation of these meetings, none of which span
  the full range of hypothesized meeting quality variables (e.g., meeting structure,
  use of data). In response, an instrument was developed and evaluated for measuring
  perceptions of team meetings by school-based personnel. After expert content validation
  and cognitive pretesting took place, 277 respondents completed the 46-item measure
  in its entirety. Respondents were mostly female (n = 164, 59%) and taught general
  education (n = 111, 40%). Results from an Exploratory Factor Analysis suggested
  that, contrary to the hypothesized model, respondents completed the measure in a
  manner that suggested a three-factor solution consisting of Goals and Data, Facilitator
  Effectiveness, and Interpersonal Perception. A smaller set of broader constructs
  may be more appropriate for future instrumentation.
