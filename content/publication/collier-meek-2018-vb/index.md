abstract: Implementation of research-based, Tier 1 behavior management strategies
  can be monitored to provide data-driven feedback and in support of integrity. The
  Measure of Active Supervision and Interaction (MASI) was developed to measure four
  behavior management practices (i.e., Praise, Correction, References to Behavior
  Expectations, Active Supervision) using systematic direct observation. This study
  was designed to address research questions related to reliability and validity by
  applying the MASI to evaluate staff behavior in seven out-of-school time programs.
  Findings indicate that two raters can complete the MASI with high agreement. Ratings
  are attributable largely to desirable sources of variance, and content validators
  positively rate the measure. Results are nonsignificantly correlated with established
  implementation measures for Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports.
