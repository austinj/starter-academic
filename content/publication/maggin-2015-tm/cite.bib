 abstract = {The successful implementation of school-based behavioral interventions requires school personnel to be competent with program content and procedures. An unfortunate trend within school-based behavioral intervention research is that the core intervention components and implementation features are often not fully described. Without clear descriptions of these critical elements, it is difficult for school personnel to successfully identify, adopt, and implement research-based programs. The practical implications that study reporting has on the integration of research into practice is illustrated in the present study through a systematic review of a widely researched anxiety prevention program. Results indicated that study authors often did not provide sufficient detail on the intervention components used and whether those components were implemented with sufficient levels of treatment fidelity. Moreover, the supports used to facilitate the implementation of the intervention varied widely across studies. These findings are discussed in relation to evidence suggesting that descriptions of the independent variable are important for identifying the mechanisms of adult and student behavior change while reports of implementation features are needed to ensure school personnel are able to consider the feasibility of implementing research-based programs within applied settings. The authors conclude by describing implications for both research and practice.},
