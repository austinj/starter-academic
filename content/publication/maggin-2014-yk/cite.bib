 abstract = {The purpose of this review was to evaluate the methodological strength and overall effectiveness of the research underlying the FRIENDS program for preventing anxiety in students at low and elevated risk for developing anxiety disorders. Meta-analytic findings provided mixed results, with low-risk students exposed to the program having demonstrated small improvements over comparisons for immediate posttest measures of anxiety. Findings drawn from follow-up data collection periods indicated that low-risk students sustained initial gains on anxiety over 12 months but not beyond. In addition, no immediate posttest difference was found between students at elevated risk on measures of anxiety. These findings are discussed in terms of practical and methodological limitations of the body of research.},
