abstract: Despite its increasing recognition and use in U.S. schools, a limited amount
  of research has evaluated the effect of restorative justice (RJ) for school violence
  prevention and response. To date, there is no standardized method for RJ implementation.
  Therefore, this systematic literature review investigates peer-reviewed studies
  on the application of RJ practices in K-12 school settings. Ten articles were included
  in the review. Results of the review indicate a high degree of variability regarding
  the implementation and evaluation of RJ practices in schools. However, the majority
  of studies reported positive outcomes, including improved social relationships and
  reductions in office discipline referrals. The utility of RJ as a school violence
  prevention and intervention approach are discussed, along with future research directions.
