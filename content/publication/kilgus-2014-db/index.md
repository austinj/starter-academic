abstract: School personnel make a variety of decisions within multitiered problem-solving
  frameworks, including the decision to assign a student to group-based support, to
  design an individualized support plan, or classify a student as eligible for special
  education. Each decision is founded upon a judgment regarding whether the student
  has responded to intervention. These and other conclusions are inherently causal,
  thus requiring that educators carefully consider the internal, construct, and conclusion
  validity of each decision to ensure its defensibility. Researchers have identified
  multiple variables that are likely to moderate these validities, including the integrity
  with which interventions are implemented, the psychometric adequacy of progress-monitoring
  tools, the extent to which interventions and supports are matched to a student's
  needs, and the approach to single-case research design. We therefore review each
  of these variables in the interest of assisting practitioners to design acceptable
  and valid multi-tiered frameworks of prevention and service delivery.
