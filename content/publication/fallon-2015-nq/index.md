abstract: Optimal levels of treatment fidelity, a critical moderator of intervention
  effectiveness, are often difficult to sustain in applied settings. It is unknown
  whether performance feedback, a widely researched method for increasing educators'
  treatment fidelity, is an evidence-based practice. The purpose of this review was
  to evaluate the current research on performance feedback as a strategy to promote
  the implementation of school-based practices. Studies were evaluated according to
  What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; Kratochwill et al., 2010) technical guidelines for
  single-case design, utilizing both the design and evidence standards to determine
  whether studies provided sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of performance
  feedback. Results indicate that performance feedback can be termed an evidence-based
  intervention based on criteria set by the WWC. Implications for future research
  are described.
