abstract: Class-wide behavioral interventions are a feasible and effective method
  to support the behavior of all students. In six peer-reviewed studies, Tootling,
  a class-wide intervention that combines positive peer reporting with an interdependent
  group contingency, has increased positive peer reports and academically engaged
  behavior (AEB), and decreased disruptive behavior (DB). However, no prior studies
  have been conducted with middle school students, and none have employed strategies
  to promote enduring behavior change. A withdrawal design with maintenance phase,
  implemented across two middle school classrooms, found moderate effects (nonoverlap
  of all pairs [NAP] = 0.74, Tau-U = âˆ’0.48) of Tootling on decreasing DB and moderate
  to large effects (NAP = 0.76, Tau-U = 0.68) on increasing AEB, although internal
  threats to validity prevented the demonstration of a clear functional relationship
  across both classrooms. Results from the maintenance phase, in which the group contingency
  reward was removed, suggest promising strategies to support durable behavioral change.
  Limitations of the present study, directions for future research, social validity,
  and implications for practice are discussed.
