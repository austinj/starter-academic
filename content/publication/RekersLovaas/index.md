abstract: "In 1974, Rekers and Lovaas published an article in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA) wherein the authors coached a child’s parents to ignore and physically abuse that child when he engaged in gender-non-conforming behaviors. In October 2020, the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior (SEAB) and JABA’s editor-in-chief Dr. Linda LeBlanc published a Statement of Concern regarding Rekers and Lovaas (1974), which described concerns regarding the paper and then provided justification for the journal’s decision to not retract this paper. In this current response, I articulate criticisms of JABA’s rationale for not retracting this paper. I acknowledge the ambiguity in the evidence available regarding a determination of ethical conduct, and end with an argument that Rekers and Lovaas (1974) should be retracted."
