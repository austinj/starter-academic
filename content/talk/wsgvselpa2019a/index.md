# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Attendees at the training learned (a) how to use information from a functional behavior assessment to design a behavior intervention plan that addresses prevention, teaching, and response strategies, (b) how to develop plans that are usable by teachers, paraprofessionals, and other staff, and (c) how to think ahead for adaptations to a behavior intervention plan, and how to respond when things donâ€™t go as expected. The focus on the training was on writing usable and effective behavior intervention plans that are directly aligned with the results of a functional behavior assessment."
