abstract: Although widely recommended, evidence‐based interventions are not regularly
  utilized by school practitioners. Video self‐modeling is an effective and efficient
  evidence‐based intervention for a variety of student problem behaviors. However,
  like many other evidence‐based interventions, it is not frequently used in schools.
  As video creation technology becomes increasingly accessible, school psychologists
  are better able to incorporate video self‐modeling into their practice. Built on
  a comprehensive review, this article describes the procedures for implementing a
  video self‐modeling intervention in educational settings. Video self‐modeling procedures
  described herein include (a) deciding whether video self‐modeling is an appropriate
  intervention for a situation, (b) planning for and preparing video self‐modeling
  procedures, (c) videotaping, (d) editing the video, (e) presenting the video, and
  (f) using video self‐modeling with other behavioral techniques. Additionally, further
  resources are offered.
