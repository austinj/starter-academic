abstract: In this study, generalizability theory was used to examine the extent to
  which (a) time-sampling methodology, (b) number of simultaneous behavior targets,
  and (c) individual raters influenced variance in ratings of academic engagement
  for an elementary-aged student. Ten graduate-student raters, with an average of
  7.20 hr of previous training in systematic direct observation and 58.20 hr of previous
  direct observation experience, scored 6 videos of student behavior using 12 different
  time-sampling protocols. Five videos were submitted for analysis, and results for
  observations using momentary time-sampling and whole-interval recording suggested
  that the majority of variance was attributable to the rating occasion, although
  results for partial-interval recording generally demonstrated large residual components
  comparable with those seen in prior research. Dependability coefficients were above
  .80 when averaging across 1 to 2 raters using momentary time-sampling, and 2 to
  3 raters using whole-interval recording. Ratings derived from partial-interval recording
  needed to be averaged over 3 to 7 raters to demonstrate dependability coefficients
  above .80.
