 abstract = {Generalizability Theory (GT) offers several advantages relevant to educational contexts, including the fact that it can be used to estimate multiple sources of variance (e.g., raters, forms) simultaneously and to derive coefficients for the purposes of both relative and absolute decision making. Although GT has been increasingly applied in recent years to assessment data in K--12 school settings, analysis and critique of its application has not yet taken place. The goals of the current article were therefore to (1) undertake a systematic review of the school-based assessment literature in order to identify relevant applications of this statistical framework and (2) assess the degree of consistency between methodological recommendations for use of GT and reporting practices within this literature. In addition to describing the current state of this literature, suggestions for strengthening future applications are provided.},
