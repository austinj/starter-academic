abstract: The purpose of this review was to evaluate the methodological strength and
  overall effectiveness of the research underlying the FRIENDS program for preventing
  anxiety in students at low and elevated risk for developing anxiety disorders. Meta-analytic
  findings provided mixed results, with low-risk students exposed to the program having
  demonstrated small improvements over comparisons for immediate posttest measures
  of anxiety. Findings drawn from follow-up data collection periods indicated that
  low-risk students sustained initial gains on anxiety over 12 months but not beyond.
  In addition, no immediate posttest difference was found between students at elevated
  risk on measures of anxiety. These findings are discussed in terms of practical
  and methodological limitations of the body of research.
