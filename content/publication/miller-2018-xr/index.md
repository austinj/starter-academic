abstract: 'Reliable and valid data form the foundation for evidence-based practices,
  yet surprisingly few studies on school-based behavioral assessments have been conducted
  which implemented one of the most fundamental approaches to construct validation,
  the multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM). To this end, the current study examined
  the reliability and validity of data derived from three commonly utilized school-based
  behavioral assessment methods: Direct Behavior Rating -- Single Item Scales, systematic
  direct observations, and behavior rating scales on three common constructs of interest:
  academically engaged, disruptive, and respectful behavior. Further, this study included
  data from different sources including student self-report, teacher report, and external
  observers. A total of 831 students in grades 3--8 and 129 teachers served as participants.
  Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations of the MTMM, as well as single and
  multi-level structural equation modeling. Results suggested the presence of strong
  methods effects for all the assessment methods utilized, as well as significant
  relations between constructs of interest. Implications for practice and future research
  are discussed.'
