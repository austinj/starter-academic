@article{Katic2020-ne,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Despite its increasing recognition and use in U.S.
               schools, a limited amount of research has evaluated the effect
               of restorative justice (RJ) for school violence prevention and
               response. To date, there is no standardized method for RJ
               implementation. Therefore, this systematic literature review
               investigates peer-reviewed studies on the application of RJ
               practices in K-12 school settings. Ten articles were included in
               the review. Results of the review indicate a high degree of
               variability regarding the implementation and evaluation of RJ
               practices in schools. However, the majority of studies reported
               positive outcomes, including improved social relationships and
               reductions in office discipline referrals. The utility of RJ as
               a school violence prevention and intervention approach are
               discussed, along with future research directions.},
