# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Researchers hold a significant responsibility for making research consumable for school-based practitioners, but itâ€™s unclear to what extent this responsibility is perceived by special educators and what individual- and organizational-level factors influence research utilization. This presentation describes structured interviews with special education teachers regarding how and why research informs their practice. Attendees will learn about reported barriers and facilitators to research implementation, and possible next steps to bridge the research to practice gap."
