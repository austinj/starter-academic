abstract: A two-part systematic review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness
  of token economies in increasing rates of appropriate classroom behavior for students
  demonstrating behavioral difficulties. The first part of the review utilized the
  recently published What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards for evaluating single-subject
  research to determine the extent to which eligible studies demonstrated sufficient
  evidence to classify the token economy as an evidence-based practice. The second
  part of the review employed meta-analytic techniques across four different types
  of effect sizes to evaluate the quantitative strength of the findings. Methodological
  strengths and weaknesses across the studies were systematically investigated. Results
  indicated that the extant research on token economies does not provide sufficient
  evidence to be deemed best-practice based on the WWC criteria.
