abstract: Research suggests that class-wide academic engagement can be improved by
  research-based classroom management. However, teachers struggle to implement classroom
  management consistently and may need ongoing support. Identifying critical components
  of classroom management could help illuminate mechanisms of action and streamline
  teacher implementation while achieving the same positive student outcomes. This
  exploratory study evaluates the relative contributions of teachers' implementation
  of 14 best practice classroom management strategies on class-wide academic engagement.
  Findings suggest that frequent references to the schedule and routines, behavior-specific
  praise, and low rates of error correction are significantly related to high rates
  of class-wide academic engagement. We highlight implications for researchers interested
  in classroom management and its core components as well as school psychologists
  providing classroom management support to teachers.
