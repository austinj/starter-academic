As an Associate Professor at the University of California, Riverside, I serve as the Program Director of our APA-accredited and NASP-approved <a href="https://education.ucr.edu/school-psychology">School Psychology program</a>. I received my PhD in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in School Psychology) from the University of Connecticut in 2014. Back in 2007, I graduated summa cum laude with my Bachelor's in Psychology from the University of Arizona. After serving as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Project Manager with the IES-funded <a href="http://needs2.education.uconn.edu/">NEEDs2 project</a> from 2014-2015, I joined the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Riverside. At UCR, I teach undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in behavior assessment and intervention, research, and methodology. I'm a <a href="https://firstgen.ucr.edu/">first-generation college graduate</a>. I really like my job.

I'm an Associate Editor for the Journal of School Psychology, as well as a licensed psychologist in the state of California (CA #29540) and a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (Certification #1-15-18892). You can request copies of articles through <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Austin_Johnson2">ResearchGate</a>, view citations and such on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XQ7qJWwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>, and download data and project materials from <a href="https://osf.io/wp2u4/">Open Science Framework</a>.

Outside of work, I host a weekly radio show called the <a href = "https://www.quadraphonic.org">Quadraphonic Rock Block</a> on UCR's campus radio station <a href = "https://www.kucr.org">KUCR</a>, hang out with my family, drink coffee, and am a very mediocre climber.
