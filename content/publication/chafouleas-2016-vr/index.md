abstract: Recognition of the benefits to trauma-informed approaches is expanding,
  along with commensurate interest in extending delivery within school systems. Although
  information about trauma-informed approaches has quickly burgeoned, systematic attention
  to integration within multitiered service delivery frameworks has not occurred yet
  is essential to accurate, durable, and scalable implementation. In addition, there
  is a critical need to concurrently build a strong evidence base regarding trauma-informed
  service delivery in schools. In this paper, the literatures on trauma-informed approaches
  and multitiered frameworks for school-based service delivery are connected with
  the goal to provide suggestions toward building blueprints for trauma-informed service
  delivery in schools. Drawing from the literature on implementation blueprints for
  school-wide positive behavior supports, sections are organized around current knowledge
  about trauma-informed approaches with regard to blueprints for (a) implementation,
  (b) professional development, and (c) evaluation. Critical issues, strategy recommendations,
  and directions for research are discussed.
