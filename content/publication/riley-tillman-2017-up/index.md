abstract: Multi-tiered problem-solving models that focus on promoting positive outcomes
  for student behavior continue to be emphasized within educational research. Although
  substantial work has been conducted to support systems-level implementation and
  intervention for behavior, concomitant advances in behavior assessment have been
  limited. This is despite the central role that data derived from behavior assessment
  methods must play in making defensible multi-tiered decisions such as those for
  screening and progress monitoring. In this commentary, the role of assessment in
  the evidence-based practice movement is described, alongside necessary features
  of behavior assessment methods utilized in multi-tiered systems. The relevance of
  these features to articles in this special issue is described. Finally, observations
  and suggestions for future directions regarding the current state of behavior assessment
  in educational research are offered.
