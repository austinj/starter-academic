abstract: The following paper provides a response to the recent critique of our review
  of the FRIENDS For Life anxiety prevention and intervention program. In their critique,
  Barrett, Cooper, Stallard, Zeggio, & Gallegos-Guajardo (2017) expressed concerns
  on a range of conceptual, methodological, and interpretative issues. Our rejoinder
  addresses each of these points and reasserts our position that the primary concern
  with the studies was the use of the wrong unit of analysis when analyzing the data.
  Our response is contextualized in the importance of rigorous research as an essential
  component of evidence-based practice.
