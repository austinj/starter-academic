abstract: Group contingencies are recognized as a potent intervention for addressing
  challenging student behavior in the classroom, with research reviews supporting
  the use of this intervention platform going back more than four decades. Over this
  time period, the field of education has increasingly emphasized the role of research
  evidence for informing practice, as reflected in the increased use of systematic
  reviews and meta-analyses. In the current article, we continue this trend by applying
  recently developed between-case effect size measures and transparent visual analysis
  procedures to synthesize an up-to-date set of group contingency studies that used
  single-case designs. Results corroborated recent systematic reviews by indicating
  that group contingencies are generally effective---particularly for addressing challenging
  behavior in general education classrooms. However, our review highlights the need
  for more research on students with disabilities and the need to collect and report
  information about participants' functional level.
