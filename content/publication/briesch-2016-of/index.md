abstract: Generalizability Theory (GT) offers several advantages relevant to educational
  contexts, including the fact that it can be used to estimate multiple sources of
  variance (e.g., raters, forms) simultaneously and to derive coefficients for the
  purposes of both relative and absolute decision making. Although GT has been increasingly
  applied in recent years to assessment data in K--12 school settings, analysis and
  critique of its application has not yet taken place. The goals of the current article
  were therefore to (1) undertake a systematic review of the school-based assessment
  literature in order to identify relevant applications of this statistical framework
  and (2) assess the degree of consistency between methodological recommendations
  for use of GT and reporting practices within this literature. In addition to describing
  the current state of this literature, suggestions for strengthening future applications
  are provided.
