abstract: The purpose of this review was to examine the methods used to conduct meta-analyses
  of single-subject research involving students with and at-risk for disabilities.
  Specifically, the procedures used for preparing, aggregating, analyzing, and evaluating
  single-subject data across 68 primary syntheses were examined. In addition to these
  methodological and reporting issues, the present review also considered various
  characteristics of syntheses to determine their overall prevalence and focus. Results
  of the review indicated that the publication rate of single-subject meta-analyses
  has increased considerably in recent years, focusing equally on students with high-
  and low-incidence disabilities. This review revealed considerable variability in
  the methods and procedures used to synthesize single-subject research. Based on
  these findings, suggestions for future single-subject meta-analyses were made.
