abstract: Many teachers struggle to deliver interventions with sufficient treatment
  integrity, perhaps due to implementation variables that mediate or moderate treatment
  integrity. Potential implementation variables have frequently been conceptualized
  in ecological frameworks, including the intervention, implementer, organization,
  and external environmental levels. Although the ecological framework is a useful
  organizational tool, a measure aligned with this model of implementation variables
  has not yet been developed. This article describes the development of the Assessment
  of Ecological Implementation Influences (AEII), a measure to evaluate implementation
  variables across ecological levels. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to
  evaluate to what extent responses on the AEII reflect the hypothesized ecological
  factor structure. The model of variables from the intervention to external environment
  level was not reflected within the factor structure here. Rather, factors emerged
  that were not previously accounted for in the implementation variables literature.
  Implications for future research on the measurement of treatment integrity and implementation
  variables are described.
