abstract: "The implementation of multi-tiered systems in schools necessitates the\
  \ use of screening assessments which produce valid and reliable data to identify\
  \ students in need of tiered supports. Data derived from these screening assessments\
  \ may be evaluated according to their classification accuracy, or the degree to\
  \ which cut scores correctly identify individuals as at-risk or not-at-risk.\
  \ The current study examined the performance of mean scores derived from over 1700\
  \ students in Grades 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 using Direct Behavior Rating---Single\
  \ Item Scales. Students were rated across three time points (Fall, Winter, Spring)\
  \ by their teachers in three areas: (a) academically engaged behavior, (b) disruptive\
  \ behavior, and (c) respectful behavior. Classification accuracy indices and comparisons\
  \ among behaviors were derived using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve\
  \ analyses, partial area under the curve (pAUC) tests, and bootstrapping methods\
  \ to evaluate the degree to which mean behavior ratings accurately identified students\
  \ who demonstrated elevated behavioral symptomology on the Behavioral and Emotional\
  \ Screening System. Results indicated that optimal cut-scores for mean behavior\
  \ ratings and a composite rating demonstrated high levels of specificity, sensitivity,\
  \ and negative predictive value, with sensitivity point estimates for optimal cut-scores\
  \ exceeding .70 for individual behaviors and .75 for composite scores across grade\
  \ groups and time points."
