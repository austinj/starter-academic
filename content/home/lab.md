## The Inland Behavior Lab at the University of California, Riverside, studies the development of efficient and effective tools to support students' behavioral success, teachers' professional success, and to enact social justice for all students. :rocket:

### What do we do?

In collaboration with colleagues across the country, we're committed to:

1. Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students towards developing sophisticated research skills that are grounded in real-world problems.
2. Providing teachers and other educators with well-designed, simple, and effective behavior support tools.
3. Understanding the origins of and developing solutions to inequity in school psychology.
