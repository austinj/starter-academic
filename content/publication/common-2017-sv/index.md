abstract: This systematic review investigated one systematic approach to designing,
  implementing, and evaluating functional assessment--based interventions (FABI) for
  use in supporting school-age students with or at-risk for high-incidence disabilities.
  We field tested several recently developed methods for single-case design syntheses.
  First, we appraised the quality of individual studies and the overall body of work
  using Council for Exceptional Children's standards. Next, we calculated and meta-analyzed
  within-case and between-case effect sizes. Results indicated that studies were of
  high methodological quality, with nine studies identified as being methodologically
  sound and demonstrating positive outcomes across 14 participants. However, insufficient
  evidence was available to classify the evidence base for FABIs due to small number
  of participants within (fewer than recommended three) and across (fewer than recommended
  20) studies. Nonetheless, average within-case effect sizes were equivalent to increases
  of 118% between baseline and intervention phases. Finally, potential moderating
  variables were examined. Limitations and future directions are discussed.
